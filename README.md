This app is developed to help you locate the nearby public toilets and the direction to reach. This will also help Govt. to keep a track of all the public toilets as regular feedback will be generated from random citizens who in turn will guide the local Municipality to improve any infrastructure problem identified and keep the toilets clean. Also, the motive of building public toilets will be fulfilled. Additionally, for women this will be an added advantage as they can now know where the public toilets are, and use them whenever needed and may not rush for home
